## Semester Goals
The 1 L/s Plant Testing team is working on getting the plant up and running so that it can be performance tested this semester. We will get the 1 L/s Plant running with water first, then add the EStaRS Filter to the main body of the plant. After troubleshooting the plant for leaks and fabrication issues, we will run performance tests on the plant and compare its performance with Cornell's Water Treatment Plant.
