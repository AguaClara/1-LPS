## Introduction
The goal of the 1 Liter per Second (1 LPS) Plant Testing team this semester is to complete the fabrication of the current plant and to test the plant's performance. In Fall 2016, the 1 L/s Plant was developed based on AguaClara technology to bring sustainable water treatment to communities with smaller needs (300 people per plant). The team's mission is to create inexpensive plants that treat at a flowrate of 1 liter per second for small towns and villages that do not have the means to finance surface water treatment due to upfront costs.

Currently, the 1 LPS plant consists of an entrance tank, flocculator and sedimentation tank. The performance testing will be done using clay and coagulant to mimic real-world conditions, following traditional AguaClara concentrations. In addition to plant testing, the team has been fixing the Enclosed Stacked Rapid Sand (EStaRS) filter in order to observe differences in NTU results and to complete the full water treatment train (flocculation, sedimentation and filtration). However, for now, the plant is being run without the EStaRS as the filter itself has not been performance tested. The EStaRS in the DeFrees Lab was built in Spring and Summer 2017 (refer below to EStaRS Testing) but had only been fabricated and minimally water tested.

From the beginning of March to mid April, the DeFrees Lab was under maintenance due to a build up of water and sludge in the drain. Initially, the team thought the lab would be closed for two weeks but because this classified as an administrative and safety issue, the lab was closed for roughly six weeks. Because the lab was closed, the team was unable to water test or set up performance testing in those weeks and thus, this report lacks significant research data.

## Lever Arm Perforation
One of the first tasks the team had to complete was securing the lever arm onto the side of the entrance tank. The lever arm is a piece of equipment attached to the side of the entrance tank that allows plant operators to control the dosage of the coagulant going into the influent water. As pictured in Figure 1, the lever arm consists of a slider on the lever arm that is the moving component controlling the chemical dosage and a metal bar at the back that fits into the hole at the side of the entrance tank pictured in Figure 2.

**Figure 1:** Pictured is the lever arm before modification. Note that there is no visible way of securing the lever arm in place after sliding the metal bar into the hole at the side of the entrance tank shown in Figure 1 (circled in red). </p>

At the beginning of the semester, the lever arm and entrance tank were still separate pieces as shown in Figures 1 and 2. At this point, the lever arm could slide into the hole in Figure 2 made on the attachment at the side of the entrance tank, but there was no way to ensure that the lever arm would not slide out of the hole.

The team first found a piece to act as a pin and determined the size of it. The size of the piece was unimportant as long as its diameter was smaller than that of the metal bar for the lever arm. The lever arm was perforated according to the size of the pin using a mill as shown in Figure 4. The pin fit snugly into the perforation as shown in Figure 5.

## CDC Apparatus
During Spring 2017, AguaClara fabricated a new design of the chemical dose controller (CDC). The past research report can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zfcbvtrykhwc#/28982452/). The CDC system was designed to maintain a constant chemical dose to the treatment process as the plant flow rate and influent turbidity change. The main difference from the old design and the new is that slimmer PVC pipes were used in the new design. The current CDC system is incomplete for chlorination but is complete for coagulation, which the team is testing this semester.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Avoid passive voice

Is the old design the one made in Spring 2017? Ambiguous

Why did you make this change? The "why" of your decisions is the most important aspect? How does the slimmer pipes affect the dosing?
</div>

The CDC works in conjunction with the lever arm on the side of the entrance tank. The team has to ensure that the height of the lever arm when horizontal is the same height as the coagulant level of the CDC when the float values are submerged. Because running the 1 LPS plant first with water was the priority, the team has not properly made sure that the heights were equal on the pole. The team plans to match the heights as shown in Figure 6 after assembling all the materials needed for the coagulant run.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Why does the height of the lever arm need to be the height of coagulant level of the CDC when the float valves are submerged?

How will you match the heights?

Starting a sentence with "because" is too informal for the research report.

Why does this fix going to occur after assembling all the materials needed for a coagulant run? What else do you need?

This is a great figure, but consider labeling what the CDC and the entrance tank are.

## Dosing Tube Calculations
In order to get the proper flow rate of chemicals into the plant, the team needed to calculate the correct length and sizes for the dosing tubes. The yellow arrows in Figure 8, below, are pointing to the dosing tubes on the CDC apparatus. There are two types of dosing tubes that are two different diameters.

The first tube connects the constant head tank (CHT), which contains the chemical stock, to a tee fitting on the lever arm. The CHT is a type of flow controller that maintains a constant chemical level in its tank. The level is maintained by a float valve connected to a larger stock tank above. Its operation is governed by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:

$$ Q = \frac{h_f g \pi D^4}{128 \nu L} $$

where $Q$ is flow rate, $h_f$ is the head difference between the water level in the constant head tank and the slider on the lever, $D$ is the diameter of the tubing, $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, and $L$ is the length of the tubing.


The head difference can be changed by moving the slider on the lever arm. A change in head, $h_f$, causes an increase in flow rate, $Q$, out of the CHT, therefore increasing the coagulant dosage to the plant. An image of the CHT is shown below, in Figure 7. The CHT is the small container in the upper left corner of each figure.

The second type of dosing tube connects the tee fitting to the influent water coming into the plant. For more information on how the CDC works, the most current research report can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zfcbvtrykhwc#/28982452/).

</p>

The relationship between the flow of the plant and the coagulant dosage needs to be linear in order to be effective. This means that the relationship between flow rate and head loss needs to be linear. The actual head in the dose controller is due to both major and minor losses. In order for the relationship to remain linear, major losses need to dominate, as shown below in Figure 9.

![LinearRelationship](https://github.com/AguaClara/1-LPS/blob/master/Images/LinearRelationshipCDC.png?raw=true)

**Figure 9**: Flow rate versus head loss while varying types of head loss. Images courtesy of Monroe Weber-Shirk, found [here](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/cee4540/Syllabus).

Head loss due to friction, $h_f$, also known as major losses, is

$$ h_f = \frac{128 \nu Q L}{g \pi D^4} $$

Head loss due to expansions, $h_e$, also known as minor losses, is

$$ h_e = \frac{8 Q^2}{g (\pi)^2 D^4} \sum K_e $$

The equation for the actual head loss is shown below, which is a combination of both major and minor losses. This is shown as the blue line in figure 9.

$$ h_L (Q) = (\frac{128 \nu L}{g \pi D^4} + \frac{8Q}{g (\pi)^2 D^4} \sum K_e) Q $$

By minimizing the amount of expansions or contractions in the dose controller tubing, as well as creating more friction by decreasing diameter, $D$, major losses will dominate.

Therefore, the tube that connects the CHT to the tee fitting on the lever arm needs to be a very small diameter. Major losses will then dominate within the tube over the calculated length, leading to the proper flow rate out of the tube. The tube that connects the tee fitting to the influent water needs to be big enough that surface tension will not dominate within the tube, and
water and air can flow freely through the tube.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Great! Consider describing the difference between minor and major losses and including the equations in LaTeX here to show how this statement is backed up by the math.

Addressed.
</div>

The calculations for the length and diameter of these tubes were done using code written by the [AguaClara Infrastructure Design Engine (AIDE) team](https://github.com/AguaClara/aide_design). The code can be found below in the section "Dosing Tube Calculations" under "Python Code."

The length of the CDC tube connecting the CHT to the tee fitting will be 0.4811 meters long and $\frac{1}{16}$ inches in diameter. The diameter of the tube connecting the tee fitting to the influent water will be $\frac{1}{4}$ inches.


## CDC Plant Integration
The CDC needed to be connected and integrated into the rest of the plant as shown previously in Figure 6. The chemicals would flow from the CHT to the slider on the lever arm and through the dosing tube to the plant. As determined in the section "Dosing Tube Calculations", the size of the dosing tube connecting the CHT to the lever arm needed to be $\frac{1}{16}$ inches in diameter and the dosing tube $\frac{1}{4}$ inches. A plastic tee was acquired to connect the two dosing tubes to the lever arm as shown in Figure 9. The tee acquired was a $\frac{1}{4}$ inch female connector.

**Figure 9:** The tee connector was attached to the slider on the lever arm with a flat-headed screw.

A hole was drilled into the side of the connector to piece a flat-headed screw through it and attach it to the slider on the lever arm. The dosing tubes had barbed fittings to make water-tight connections to the tee connector. The larger diameter dosing tube connected right above the rapid mix of the first leg of the flocculator. The team drilled a $\frac{1}{4}$ inch hole into the side of the first leg of the flocculator at an arbitrary height above the rapid mix and tapped it as shown in Figure 10.

## 1 LPS Plant Water Run
The team's main focus was to run water completely through the 1 LPS plant. Depending on the progress of EStaRS testing, the team would like to run the plant with the filter to observe changes in the NTU results.

The plant has been fully connected to the water source and the drain since March as shown in Figure 8. Once the DeFrees Lab was cleared, the team water tested the plant and welded two minor leaks at the inlet and outlet. The plant is ready to go through its coagulant run.

## EStaRS Testing
The Enclosed Stacked Rapid Sand (EstaRS) Filter is an adaptation of AguaClara's Stacked Rapid Sand (StaRS) Filter. These filters make the process of sand filtration much more effective in terms of filtration time and money. Sand filters use a large area, and as flow rate through the filter increases, so does the necessary area of the filter. By stacking smaller layers of sand in between inlets and outlets, AguaClara was able the decrease the overall area of a sand filter and the residence time of the filter. The EStaRS Filter can be used by itself as a stand alone filter or at the end of a treatment train. In Figure 12, below, the process of forward filtration is shown.

![EStaRSFilter](https://github.com/AguaClara/1-LPS/blob/master/Images/EStaRSFilter.png?raw=true)

**Figure 12**: EStaRS Filter in forward filtration.

The current EStaRS filter was built in Spring 2017 with the purpose of accompanying the 1 LPS plant. The design that is now currently used is based off of a successful iteration of a previous EStaRS Filter built in 2013, then known as the Low Flow Stacked Rapid Sand Filter (LFSRSF).

The information used by the 1 LPS team to assemble the filter was found in the EStaRS Spring 2017 research report, found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/8262051cfnxfzxkmnsp#/29239180/).

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
This implies that this filter was made (for the first time) in 2017. It was designed circa 2011 I think.

What is the EStaRS?

Addressed.
</div>

The EStaRS filter was tested for water-tightness. There were leaks on welds, which were then sealed by re-welding, glue, or epoxy.  

Eventually, a filter becomes too clogged to effectively remove particles from the water flowing through it. At this point, the filter needs to be backwashed; the sand bed is fluidized by increasing the up-flow velocity of the filter. In the EStaRS Filter, this is done by pushing all of the influent water into the largest, bottom inlet. The water is pushed because of a pressure difference that occurs once the backwash siphon is opened. Once the sand bed is fluidized, the particles clogging the filter are dislodged and float to the top of the filter to be discharged as waste.

A increase in up-flow velocity also increases the amount of force that inlet and outlet manifolds have to withstand. There was concern that in this new iteration of the EStaRS Filter, the upward force during backwash would cause the manifolds to snap or break. In order to figure out if this was a cause for concern, the team conducted a force analysis on the manifolds.

The code for this analysis can be found below in the section "EStaRS Filter Force Analysis" under "Python Code."

The total force that backwash will exert on the manifolds is 679.8 newtons. Assuming that this force will be equally distributed over each of the seven manifolds, the force exerted on each manifold is 97.11 newtons. When converted to pound-force, this is approximately 21.83 lbf. Dividing that by the force due to gravity, the force exerted on each manifold is about 10 kg.

The team removed the top inlet manifold to test if 10 kg would cause it to break. Since 10 kg is equal to 10 L of water, the team applied a bucket of 10 L to the middle of the manifold. It did not break. Therefore, the team assumed that the filter manifolds can withstand the force of backwash.

In the coming weeks, the team will fill the filter with sand and measure its performance by running tests with clay and coagulant.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
How will you evaluate the impact of backwash on the inlet and outlet manifolds? What data are you looking for? (Qualitatively or Quantitatively?) What is the criteria for passing? What are the concerns?

Addressed.

### Dosing Tube Calculations

#### Variables
$g$: gravity

${h_L}$: head loss

$D$: diameter of pipe

$\nu$: kinematic viscosity of a fluid

$Q$: flow rate

$K_e$: minor loss coefficient

#### Equations
The equation for the length of a dosing tube is:

$$L = (\frac{g {h_L}_{,Max} \pi D^4}{128 \nu Q_{Max}} - \frac{Q_{Max}}{16 \pi \nu} \sum K_e)$$

where ${h_L}_{,Max}$ is the maximum head loss and $Q_{Max}$ is the maximum flow rate in the tube.

### EStaRS Filter Force Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to see if the manifolds inside the EStaRS Filter can withstand the force of backwash without breaking. This is a concern because, in Honduras, plant operators noticed in the early iterations of the filter, that the manifolds would snap and disassemble during backwash. This was because the manifolds were not held into place within the filter body.

#### Variables
`EStaRS_height`: Distance from the ground to the top of the entrance tank.

`sand_height`: Height of sand in filter body, from floor to top of first sand bed.

`total_head_available`: Amount of head loss available to power backwash.

`pressure_head`: Total head converted to a pressure.

`force_of_backwash`: Force that will be exerted on the manifold pipes during backwash. It is assumed that this force will be equally distributed over each of the seven manifolds.

$g$: gravity

#### Equations

The equation for finding pressure from head is:

$$ P_h = \rho g h$$

where $h$ is the total head available, and $\rho$ is the density of water.

The equation for finding force from pressure is:

$$ F = P A $$

where $A$ is the area of a cross-section of the filter.

#### Code
```python
rho_water = 1*(u.g/u.cm**3) #density of water
g = pc.gravity #gravity
EStaRS_height = 185*(u.cm) #measured
EStaRS_diameter = 12*(u.inch) #known
EStaRS_area = pc.area_circle(EStaRS_diameter)
sand_height = 6 * 15*(u.cm) #six sand beds each at a height of 15 # cm

total_head_available = EStaRS_height - sand_height

pressure_head = rho_water*g*total_head_available

force_of_backwash = pressure_head*EStaRS_area

print('The total force that backwash will exert on the manifolds is
      ,(force_of_backwash.to(u.N)),'. The force exerted on each manifold is
      ,(force_of_backwash.to(u.N))/7,'.')
